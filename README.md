# aws-utils

`aws-utils` is a collection of useful tools for AWS, mainly for users
of *aws cli*.

New scripts are added every now and then, whenever I need
and develop one.

They usually support `--help`, often with usage examples. If not check
the source :)

## aws-utils scripts

* **get-credentials**

* **get-instance-credentials**

* **assume-role**

* **filter-ip-ranges**

* **crawl-metadata**
